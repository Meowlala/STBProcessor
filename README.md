# STBProcessor
##### CURRENTLY WINDOWS ONLY, IF THERE IS LARGE DEMAND I MAY LOOK INTO MAKING IT COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS.
Processor to convert STB files to .xml and .lua, using Rick's StageConverter and one of my own executables.

Just drag a .stb file (such as one obtained from Isaac's resources/rooms folder, or basement renovator) over convertstb.bat

This will generate the files output.xml and output.lua. If you're using the StageAPI, output.lua is the required room file.
